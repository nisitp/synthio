                <p class="body">Many B2B companies have launched ABM initiatives, but many are struggling with how to balance these more targeted programs versus traditional, lead-focused demand generation. While marketing teams are realizing that the precise focus of ABM requires deeper and more accurate contact data, they are also looking for ways to adapt and borrow from the traditional programs and strategies they have successfully utilized for years in broader acquisition campaigns.
                   
                <br/><br/> The emerging reality — according to industry thought leaders and many experienced B2B practitioners — is that both ABM and lead-focused demand gen have a role to play in today’s B2B marketing efforts to prioritize high-value accounts and identify new prospects.

However, you also should be augmenting these accounts with key metadata such as firmographic elements, including their vertical, geo, size, and other elements, to help with content personalization and segmentation.”</b>

"Potential buyers tune out because the content doesn’t speak to their issues, needs, or situations. <b>The reason ABM has taken off and been so successful is that marketers are taking a much more targeted, outside-in, issues-based approach: identify the most relevant accounts for your solutions, invest heavily in buyer and market insight so you really understand what matters to those accounts (and the key decision makers and influencers within them), and then design customized and personalized campaigns to reach them.”</b>

                <p class="body">New advancements in technology are helping marketers leverage the most powerful aspects of both strategies. Arguably the biggest shared component is lead identification, although the method differs: traditional lead generation focuses on quantity, while lead generation that powers ABM stresses quality and identifying the most likely buyers. To avoid narrowing the field down too much, ABM needs to borrow some traditional lead gen tactics.
                    <br/><br/> SiriusDecisions, for example, recently rolled out a new demand waterfall framework designed to help companies better define and target their total addressable market by honing in on buying groups—a collection of personas—rather than individual leads and inquiries. The updated framework also codifies the process of identifying and targeting active buyers.

                        <p class="body">Armed with a client’s closed-won account information from a CRM, leading data management firms can extrapolate commonalities from that existing buyer list, layering on additional firmographic and technographic qualifiers, to not only build out account personas but also to construct contact (or buyer) personas as well. This process arms marketers with additional insight into their customers so that they can then identify new accounts that share those commonalities. These data points reflect the most commonly found industries, annual revenue ranges, employee counts, and installed software usage; contact personas pinpoint the most popular titles, skills, group affiliations, and key words within an existing customer base.

                With large buying centers and multiple buying groups now the norm in B2B, pinpointing the right individuals and data points to focus on is essential to help create relevant and strategic messages. Buyer personas and account personas are essentially separate and require different approaches. The process for identifying best-fit account personas revolves around the analysis of existing customer account data, but the process for identifying best-fit contacts relies on an extensive analysis of every person involved in each of those closed-won opportunities.
                <br/><br/> Because people—not accounts—sign contracts and checks, individuals are the endgame with ABM. There are far more data points to analyze and understand for persona selection due to the complexity and depth of the modern buying group. Marketers must consider the variety of roles involved in the decision-making process and deliver relevant messaging to each segment. The decision-makers in the buying group are often affected by influencers and potential end users, so it is imperative to wholly understand each type of stakeholder in the overall purchase decision to ensure relevancy and engagement.

                Once marketers have identified net new, ideal target accounts and ideal targeted personas, they must now drill down on identifying the actual person that not only fits the persona, but also works at the target account. This is one of the more difficult parts to fully defining the target audience; although it can be done manually, there are also data solutions and tools that can automate this matching process.

                    Vernon said the company also reduced its reliance on "spray and pray" marketing and relied more on a persona-based approach.

                    <br/><br/> Working with Synthio also allowed Administrate to more than double its Middle East-North Africa contact pool from 9,000 to more than 19,000 names in the last five months.

                <br/><br/> “Being thoughtful with your content and trying to find ways to stand out are really important,” Wellschlager added. “You have to create content that people can connect with quickly. Moving away from static content is absolutely crucial to being intelligent with your time.”
