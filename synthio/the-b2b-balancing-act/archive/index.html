                    <p><span>Many B2B companies have launched ABM initiatives,</span> but many are struggling with how to balance these more targeted programs versus traditional demand generation. While marketing teams are realizing that the precise focus of ABM requires deeper and more accurate contact data, they are also looking for ways to adapt and borrow from the traditional programs and strategies they have successfully utilized for years in broader acquisition campaigns. The emerging reality, according to industry thought leaders and many experienced B2B practitioners, is both ABM and demand gen have a role to play in today’s B2B marketing efforts to prioritize high-value accounts and identify new prospects. Finding the healthy balance between the two is the goal, and industry experts agreed that embracing ABM is not simply a matter of flipping a switch.

                    <p>By now, it’s common knowledge that traditional demand gen focuses on a mix of inbound and outbound marketing efforts, while ABM skews more toward targeted outbound offers.
                        <br/><br/> “You’re often targeting accounts that have not yet raised their hand or expressed a specific need for your solutions. As such, more emphasis needs to be placed on building initial awareness, interest and relevancy to inspire them to want to learn more,” said Tyler Lessard, VP, Vidyard.

                        <br/><br/> David Lewis, CEO, DemandGen International, argues that the biggest difference with an ABM approach will come from how marketers go about operationalizing account data for targeting and content purposes. <b>“Having a well-defined set of target accounts in your CRM is a key first step. However, you also should be augmenting these accounts with key meta-data such as firmographic elements including their vertical, geo, size and other elements to help with content personalization and segmentation.”</b> </p>

                    <p><span>“Traditional demand gen too often has been driven by inside-out, ‘buy my solution’ generic messaging,</span> said Rob Leavitt, Senior VP of ITSMA. “Potential buyers tune out because the content doesn’t speak to their issues, needs or situations. The reason ABM has taken off and been so successful is that marketers are taking a much more targeted, outside-in, issues-based approach: Identify the most relevant accounts for your solutions, invest heavily in buyer and market insight so you really understand what matters to those accounts (and the key decision makers and influencers within them), and then design customized and personalized campaigns to reach them.”
                        <br/><br/> <b>“There’s a place for both traditional demand gen and ABM, and the organization needs to figure out when and where in their growth strategy inbound fits best versus ABM,” said Greene. </b></p>

                <h3>Automating Account Selection</h3>
                <p>New advancements in technology are helping marketers to leverage the most powerful aspects of both strategies. Arguably the biggest shared component is lead identification, although the method differs: Traditional lead generation focuses on quantity, while lead generation that powers ABM stresses quality, identifying the most likely buyers. To avoid narrowing the field down too much, ABM needs to borrow some traditional lead gen tactics.
                    <br/><br/> SiriusDecisions, for example, recently rolled out a new demand waterfall framework designed to help companies better define and target their total addressable market by honing in on buying groups—a collection of personas—rather than individual leads and inquiries. The updated framework also codifies the process of identifying and targeting active buyers.
                    <br/><br/> Armed with a client’s closed-won account information from a CRM, leading data management firms can extrapolate commonalities from that existing buyer list, layering on additional firmographic and technographic qualifiers, to not only build out account personas, but to also construct contact (or buyer) personas as well. This process arms marketers with additional insight into their customers so that they can then identify new accounts that share those commonalities. These data points reflect the most commonly found industries, annual revenue ranges, employee counts, and installed software usage; contact personas pinpoint the most popular titles, skills, group affiliations, and key words within an existing customer base.

                    <h3>Matching Targeted Personas To Targeted Accounts</h3>
                    <p>With large buying centers and multiple buying groups now the norm in B2B, pinpointing the right individuals and data points to focus on is essential to help create relevant and strategic messages. Buyer personas and account personas are essentially separate, and require different approaches. The process for identifying best fit accounts revolves around the analysis of existing customer account data, but the process for identifying best fit contacts relies on an extensive analysis of every person involved in each of those closed-won opportunities.

                    <p><span>Because people—not accounts—sign contracts and checks, individuals are the endgame with ABM.</span> There are far more data points to analyze and understand for persona selection due to the complexity and depth of the modern buying group. Marketers must consider the variety of roles involved in the process and deliver relevant messaging to each segment. The decision makers in the buying group are often affected by influencers and potential end-users, so it is imperative to wholly understand each type of stakeholder in the overall purchase decision to ensure relevancy and engagement. Leveraging demographic and behavioral data is key to determining the persona behind each stakeholder.
                        <br/><br/> Once marketers have identified net-new ideal target accounts as well as ideal targeted personas, they must now drill down on identifying the actual person that not only fits the persona, but also works at the target account. This is one of the more difficult parts to fully defining the target audience; although it can be done manually, there are also data solutions and tools that can automate this matching process.

      <p>The real power of ABM is moving beyond personas to identify and understand actual named accounts and specific individuals. Buyer and account personas can help with things like content development and campaign planning, with two caveats. First, they need to be based on deep research on buying behavior for solutions like the ones you’re selling. Second, even great personas are still only useful as guides. Personalization based on insight into the specific named individuals and accounts is still the most effective way to do ABM.

                    <p><span>Over the past several years, Administrate,</span> a training software provider, has focused its marketing efforts on identifying leads that better align with its evolving product.
                        <br/><br/> “We have had to adjust our lead generation strategy a few times in the past few years to target the right people,” said Katie Vernon, Administrate’s Marketing Delivery Executive. “A year ago, for example, we were targeting training departments within companies. As our product has evolved and its capabilities expanded, our target clients have as well. We realized we were really a better fit for larger companies that sell training services.    <br/><br/> Vernon said the company also reduced its reliance on "spray and pray" marketing and relied more on a persona-based approach.

                        <br/><br/> Working with Synthio also allowed Administrate to more than double its Middle East-North Africa contact pool from 9,000 to more than 19,000 names in the last five months. <br/><br/> “Beyond quantity, we are more interested in the improved quality of leads,” Vernon said. “We like to be able to add companies and websites and generate leads quickly instead of relying on manually going through professional social networks or trade shows.”

                    </h3>
                    <p>Once the optimal audience is identified, the right content strategy needs to be implemented to engage those contacts. However, experts noted that one of the biggest mistakes seen among people going all-in on an ABM strategy is they only do account-level campaigns.

                    <span>“What we’ve found</span> is that if you start to look at both accounts and segments by personas or buying groups, you can come up with really targeted, thoughtful micro-campaigns that span multiple companies,” said Matthew Wellschlager, VP of Marketing, CEROS. “You can take 50 very similar companies and do a small campaign to their accounts people and something that’s more targeted. That can then help you identify who the most engaged people are and who you want to nurture.”
                    <br/><br/>
                    This deeper insight can enable marketers to identify key pain points and areas of interest which can be leveraged in the content production process—ultimately leading to the creation of more relevant and contextual content.
                    <br/><br/> “Being thoughtful with your content and trying to find ways to stand out are really important,” Wellschlager added. “You have to create content that people can connect with quickly. Moving away from static content is absolutely pivotal to being intelligent with your time.”</p>

                        <br/><br/> “Successful ABM execution requires identifying the right contacts in an account and engaging them with relevant, high-value content,” Priolo said. SPI teamed up with Synthio to accomplish the first half of that strategy.
                        <br/><br/> “Synthio makes it easy to find the depth and breadth of contacts we need to drive our program. I especially value the quality of Synthio's contact information,” he added.

                        <br/><br/> “Prior to becoming a Synthio customer, we did an inordinate amount of slow, manual research and list building. Synthio has helped us save time and money, but most importantly, enabled successful execution of our ABM program,” Priolo added.
